Gatsby source plugin for working with official [Notion](https://notion.so) API.

## ðŸš§ It's a work in progress

This is a source plugin for pulling content into Gatsby from official public Notion API (currently
in beta). With this plugin, you will be able to query your Notion pages in Gatsby using GraphQL.

[Notion API Reference](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro)

An example (...coming soon)

## Install

```sh
yarn add gatsby-source-notion-api
```

or

```sh
npm install --save gatsby-source-notion-api
```

## How to use

Before using this plugin, make sure you

1. Created a Notion integration (sign in to Notion, go to `Settings & Memberships` â†’ `Integrations`
   â†’ `Develop your own integrations`,
   [short link to the Integrations creation section](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)). It's
   OK to use an internal one. Don't forget to copy the token.
2. Go to the database you want to have access to and share it with the integration (`Share` â†’ Select
   the integration in the `Invite` dropdown). Don't forget the database in the URL. It's a series of
   characters after the last slash and before the question mark. Here's a reference:
   https://www.notion.so/{USER}/**{DATABASE_ID}**?{someotherirrelevantstuff}
3. Then add this to your `gatsby-config.json`:

```javascript
plugins: [
	{
		resolve: `gatsby-source-notion-api`,
		options: {
			token: `$INTEGRATION_TOKEN`,
			databaseId: `$DATABASE_ID`,
		},
	},
	// ...
]
```

## Configuration options

`token` [string][required]

Integration token.

`databaseId` [string][required]

The identifier of the database you want to get pages from. The integration identified by provided
token must have access to the database with given id.

## How to query for nodes

You can query for pages with `notion` or grab all of them with `allNotion`. The raw content of the
page is available under `raw` property.

### Query for all nodes

```graphql
query {
	allNotion {
		edges {
			node {
				raw
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Current state

- Due to the fact that Notion API only appeared recently, and it is still in beta, some blocks are
  marked "unsupported". Among others, images cannot be fetched for now
- Currently, `gatsby-source-notion-api` can only work with one provided database. In further
  releases, all databases reachable by the Integration will be available for querying
- Nested blocks are currently skipped. E.g. if a list item has a nested sublist, it's contents will
  be omitted. This will be fixed in the nearest releases
- Only raw content is available. Raw meaning whatever Notion returns. Further releases will aim at
  providing a more convenient data format apart from the raw one
